Payday Lending in America: Policy Solutions‚Äù is the third report in a series that provides information for policymakers as they consider ways to make small-dollar loans work better for borrowers. Research is unclear on whether high-interest small loans are beneficial to consumers with poor credit histories, but better regulation is needed regardless. Based on findings from the reports, Pew recommends that when policymakers choose to allow these loans, the following regulations should be in place to minimize harm to consumers and to maintain a marketplace for lenders:

Limit payments to an affordable percentage of a borrower's periodic income.
(Research indicates that payments above 5 percent of gross income are often unaffordable.)
Spread costs evenly over the life of the loan.
Guard against harmful repayment requirements or collections practices.
Require concise disclosures that reflect periodic and total costs upfront.
Continue to set maximum allowable charges for small-dollar-loan markets that serve those with poor credit.

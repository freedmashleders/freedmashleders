A poll of payday loan borrowers, which also appears in the latest report, indicates support for such reform. The nationally representative survey of payday loan borrowers reveals that an overwhelming 9 in 10 support a system of installment payments over time instead of the conventional lump-sum-repayment structure. Moreover, 8 in 10 favor payments that fit consumers' budgets by taking a more manageable amount of each paycheck.

“People who use payday loans are struggling,” Bourke added. “Most are paying bank overdraft fees, most carry credit card or other debt, and almost all have credit scores at the low end of the scale. Evidence shows that lump-sum payday loans harm consumers compared with loans that have affordable payments. It is possible to make this market work better for borrowers in a way that is viable for lenders.”

Pew's recommendations draw on a detailed analysis of regulation in Colorado, where state policymakers replaced a single, unaffordable, lump-sum repayment with a series of installment payments distributed over six months. Combined with significant safeguards that protect consumers from unscrupulous practices, this focus on affordability transformed payday lending in that state. Borrowers now pay 42 percent less annually than they did under the conventional model. And even though storefronts have consolidated, credit remains widely available, with more customers served at each location. The Colorado law has considerable shortcomings, including a complicated price structure and interest rates that may be higher than necessary to lend to those with poor credit histories and still make a profit. Yet it provides an important case study for regulators.
